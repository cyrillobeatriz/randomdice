# randomdice
Randomness has many uses in science, arts, statistics, cryptography, games, gambling, and other fields. In this exercise, I used randomness to simulate a game using the random package, a subpackage of numpy.
In this game, we have a number of cookies that the user can eat based on the random number rolled on the die. They can eat more, less, or none at all.
